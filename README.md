# Flag Memory Game

![Flag Memory Game](/assets/images/responsive-design-ms2.png)\

**Live Page**: https://anee127.github.io/Milestone-Project-2/

**This game is part of the second Milestone Project carried out through the Code Institute.**

This webpage was created to launch a simple memory card game that people of all ages can play. The purpose it to match pairs of cards together with the same countryâ€™s flag design. The website itself is an example of my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There is a link to the GitHub repository, in the footer, for users who wish to see the code behind the webpage.
